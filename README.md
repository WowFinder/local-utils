# @wowfinder/local-utils

_**Note:** This repo is meant to contain "quick and dirty" code that isn't held to the same quality standards as the rest of the WowFinder project. It provides small utilities to make my work on the other repos easier, so don't expect me to invest any net work on this. Said that, if any of the code may be useful to you, feel free to use it under the terms of the GPL v3 or, at your choice, any later version._

## Additional notes
- The field `private` is set on `package.json` to prevent accidental publication to the NPM registry. As stated by the `license` field and the openness of the repo itself, the code is available for reuse.
- At the moment, there is no significant versioning of the repo itself. The `version` field is set to `0.0.0` to avoid complains from linters.
